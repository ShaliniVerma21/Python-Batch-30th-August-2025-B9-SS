
#---------------------------List Comprehension in Python---------------------------

#1. Introduction

""" 
A list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python using a 
single line of code.

Syntax:
  [expression for item in iterable if condition]

Benefits:

  1. Shorter and cleaner code.
  2. Faster than using loops (in most cases).
  3. More Pythonic (recommended style).
"""

#SECTION 1 — Basic List Comprehension (No Condition)
#Directly apply an operation or transformation on each element of an iterable.

#Syntax:
  #[expression for item in iterable]
  
# 1. Square numbers from 0 to 9
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

# 2. Convert strings to uppercase
words = ["python", "java", "c++"]
upper_words = [w.upper() for w in words]
print(upper_words)

# 3. Get lengths of each word
lengths = [len(w) for w in words]
print(lengths)

# 4. Multiply each number by 10
nums = [1, 2, 3]
times_10 = [n*10 for n in nums]

# 5. Convert list of numbers to strings
num_str = [str(n) for n in [10, 20, 30]]

# 6. Add 5 to each number
plus_5 = [n+5 for n in range(5)]

# 7. Cube of each number
cubes = [n**3 for n in range(1,6)]

# 8. Double characters in a string
doubled = [ch*2 for ch in "hello"]

# 4. Words starting with 'p'
words = ["python", "java", "perl", "c"]
starts_with_p = [w for w in words if w.startswith('p')]

# 5. Words longer than 4 letters
long_words = [w for w in words if len(w) > 4]

# 6. Positive numbers only
nums = [-3, -1, 0, 2, 4]
positive_nums = [n for n in nums if n > 0]

# 7. Strings containing 'a'
contains_a = [w for w in ["cat", "dog", "apple"] if 'a' in w]

# 8. Numbers divisible by both 2 and 3
divisible = [n for n in range(30) if n%2==0 and n%3==0]

# 9. Skip empty strings
names = ["John", "", "Sam", ""]
non_empty = [n for n in names if n]

# 10. Words not equal to "java"
not_java = [w for w in words if w != "java"]


#SECTION 3 — List Comprehension with If-Else (Conditional Expressions)
# Apply a transformation depending on a condition.

#Syntax:
  #[true_expr if condition else false_expr for item in iterable]
  
# 1. Label numbers as Even or Odd
labels = ["Even" if n%2==0 else "Odd" for n in range(10)]

# 2. Replace negatives with 0

no_negatives = [n if n > 0 else 0 for n in nums]

# 3. Pass/Fail based on marks
marks = [45, 80, 30, 95]
result = ["Pass" if m>=40 else "Fail" for m in marks]

# 4. Convert numbers to strings if > 10
nums = [5, 12, 7]
converted = [str(n) if n > 10 else n for n in nums]

# 5. Grade students
scores = [90, 70, 40, 20]
grades = ["A" if s>=80 else "B" if s>=50 else "C" for s in scores]

# 6. Replace even numbers with double, odd numbers unchanged
nums = [1,2,3,4]
modified = [n*2 if n%2==0 else n for n in nums]

# 7. Uppercase short words, lowercase long words
words = ["hi", "HELLO", "bye", "GoodMorning"]
case_change = [w.upper() if len(w)<=3 else w.lower() for w in words]

# 8. Tag positive/negative numbers
nums = [-3, -1, 0, 2, 4]
